## How to Run the Application

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.x installed.
*   `pip` (Python package installer).

**Steps:**
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adiorany3/your-repo-name.git 
    ```
    (Replace the URL with the actual repository URL if available, or instruct users to clone the current repository they are viewing).
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name 
    ```
    (Replace `your-repo-name` with the actual directory name).
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

**Initial Setup Notes:**
*   The file `data_kandang.csv` can be used for initial model training if the pre-trained model file, `poultry_rf_model.joblib`, is not present.
*   `poultry_rf_model.joblib` is the file where the trained Random Forest machine learning model is stored.
*   For Telegram bot integration (notifications) and admin panel access, you will need to configure a `secrets.toml` file within a `.streamlit` directory. Detailed configuration for this will be covered in a subsequent section or a dedicated configuration guide.

## File Structure

*   `app.py`: The main Streamlit web application script containing the user interface and core logic.
*   `RandomForestPrediction.py`: Python script responsible for training the Random Forest machine learning model.
*   `poultry_rf_model.joblib`: The primary file storing the trained Random Forest model. This is loaded by `app.py` for predictions.
*   `modelawal/poultry_rf_model.joblib`: Contains an initial or backup version of the trained model.
*   `data_kandang.csv`: Sample or initial dataset that can be used for model training if `poultry_rf_model.joblib` is not available.
*   `prediksi.csv`: CSV file used to log user inputs, calculated actual IP, and predicted IP values for historical tracking and potential model retraining.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project (e.g., Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn).
*   `README.md`: This documentation file, providing information about the project.
*   `.streamlit/secrets.toml`: (User-created) Configuration file for Streamlit Cloud deployment, storing sensitive information like Telegram bot token, chat ID, and the admin panel password.
*   `header.jpeg`: Image file (likely a banner or logo) used in the application's user interface.
*   `visitors.csv`: Logs IP addresses and timestamps of unique visitors to the application for analytics.
*   `test_app.py`, `test_RandomForestPrediction.py`, `test_app_calculations.py`, `test_setup.py`: Python scripts containing unit tests to ensure the functionality of different parts of the application.
*   `importjoblib.py`: (Likely a utility script, purpose might need further clarification if essential for users, otherwise can be omitted if it's a dev tool).

## Model Details

The core of the prediction functionality lies in a machine learning model trained to estimate the Poultry Performance Index (IP).

*   **Algorithm:** The prediction model utilizes a **Random Forest Regressor**, a robust ensemble learning method implemented in the `scikit-learn` library.
*   **Target Variable:** The model is trained to predict the **`IP`** (Indeks Performa).
*   **Key Features:** The primary input features used by the model for prediction are:
    *   `Age` (Umur Panen - days)
    *   `Total_Body_Weight` (Total Bobot Badan - kg)
    *   `FCR` (Feed Conversion Ratio)
    *   `Live_Bird` (Jumlah Ayam Hidup - heads)
    *   `Ayam_Dipelihara` (Jumlah Ayam Awal Dipelihara - heads)
    *   `persen_Live_Bird` (Persentase Ayam Hidup - %)
*   **Training Data:** The model is initially trained using the data provided in `data_kandang.csv`. It is designed to be periodically retrained using the accumulated data from user inputs and results, which are logged in `prediksi.csv`. This allows the model to adapt and improve over time.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** The performance of the Random Forest model is evaluated using the following standard regression metrics:
    *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted IP values. Lower values indicate a better fit.
    *   **R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination):** Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (IP) that is predictable from the independent variables (features). Values closer to 1 indicate a better model performance.
*   **Model Persistence:** The trained machine learning model is serialized and saved to the file `poultry_rf_model.joblib` using `joblib`. This file is then loaded by the application to make predictions without needing to retrain the model every time the application starts.

## Telegram Integration

This application features an optional integration with a Telegram bot, allowing for automated notifications and file sharing directly to your Telegram account. This functionality is managed and configured via the password-protected Admin Section within the application.

**Key Bot Capabilities:**

*   **Model Performance Alerts:** Receive notifications when a newly retrained machine learning model achieves an R¬≤ score above a user-defined threshold (set in the Admin Section).
*   **File Dispatch:** Send important files, such as the trained model (`poultry_rf_model.joblib`) or the prediction history (`prediksi.csv`), directly to your Telegram chat.
*   **Data Management Notifications:** Get alerts regarding data management activities, for instance, before and after the `prediksi.csv` file is cleaned of duplicate entries.
*   **Connectivity Testing:** A test notification feature is available in the Admin Section to verify that the Telegram bot is correctly configured and connected.

**Configuration:**

To enable Telegram integration, you must provide your Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID. This is done by creating or editing the `secrets.toml` file located in the `.streamlit` directory of your project. Add the following lines to this file:

```toml
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your_actual_bot_token_here"
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "your_actual_chat_id_here"
```

**Important:**
*   Replace `"your_actual_bot_token_here"` with the token you receive from BotFather on Telegram.
*   Replace `"your_actual_chat_id_here"` with your personal or group chat ID where you want to receive messages.
*   The Telegram bot functionality will remain inactive if these secrets are not correctly configured in `secrets.toml` or if the "Enable Telegram Bot" option is turned off in the Admin Section of the application.

## Admin Section

The application includes a dedicated "Pengaturan" (Settings) area, accessible from the sidebar, which serves as the admin panel. This section is password-protected and provides administrators with tools to manage the application, model, and user-facing features.

**Accessing the Admin Section:**

To access the admin panel, you must first set an admin password. This is configured in the `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file by adding the following entry:

```toml
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your_secure_password_here"
```
Replace `"your_secure_password_here"` with a strong, unique password. If this password is not set in the `secrets.toml` file, the Admin Section will not be accessible.

**Admin Panel Functionalities:**

The Admin Section offers the following management capabilities:

*   **Telegram Bot Management:**
    *   Enable or disable the Telegram bot integration for sending notifications and files.
    *   Send a test notification to verify the Telegram bot configuration (Bot Token and Chat ID must be set in `secrets.toml` as detailed in the "Telegram Integration" section).

*   **Model & Notification Settings:**
    *   Define the R¬≤ score threshold that determines if a newly retrained model is considered "high-performing."
    *   Enable or disable automatic Telegram notifications for when a model meets this high-performance R¬≤ threshold.

*   **Model Training & Data Management:**
    *   Manually initiate the model retraining process. This typically uses new data accumulated in `prediksi.csv` along with the initial `data_kandang.csv`.
    *   Perform data cleaning by removing duplicate entries from the `prediksi.csv` file to ensure data quality for retraining.
    *   Option to trigger model retraining using the complete dataset, combining all records from both `data_kandang.csv` and `prediksi.csv`.

*   **User Interface (UI) Settings:**
    *   Control the visibility of performance graphs and data visualizations for regular users of the application.

*   **Security:**
    *   A "Logout" button is provided to securely end the admin session and protect the admin panel from unauthorized access.
